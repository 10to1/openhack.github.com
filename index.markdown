## What is OpenHack?

OpenHack is a meetup with a simple purpose: Code together, on anything.

OpenHack works by hosting a meetup in your city that gets programmers of any experience level together to code. Here's how an OpenHack night meetup runs:

* You can hack on anything! Any language, framework, public/open-source, personal, etc.
* You don't have to have an idea to hack on! You're more than welcome to come just to pair with someone.
* Start off with a quick round of introductions **(every night!)**, to say who you are, what you're working on, and if you'd like help with your idea.
* Provide food and some coffee/drinks for attendees. Sponsors will help immensely with funding this.
* Someone has to host the meetup. That person is in charge of ordering food and starting off the intro.
* Don't go too late. 9-10pm is good. Focus usually wanes by this point, for obvious reasons! Maybe if there's interest head to a bar for more discussion.

Of course, every OpenHack is going to be different. These are simply guidelines, and they're meant to be [forked](https://github.com/openhack/openhack.github.com). We'd love to hear feedback and see how OpenHack works in other cities!

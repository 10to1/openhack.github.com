      <p>
        Code together, on anything. Host a meetup in your city, get programmers of any experience level together, and build something! Here's how an OpenHack night works:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>You can hack on anything! Any language, framework, public/open-source, personal, etc.</a>
        <li>You don't have to have an idea to hack on! You're more than welcome to come just to pair with someone.</li>
        <li>Start off with a quick round of introductions <strong>(every night!)</strong>, to say who you are, what you're working on, and if you'd like help with your idea.</li>
        <li>Provide food and some coffee/drinks for attendees. Sponsors will help immensely with funding this.</a>
        <li>Someone has to host the meetup. That person is in charge of ordering food and starting off the intro.</li>
        <li>Don't go too late. 9-10pm is good. Focus usually wanes by this point, for obvious reasons! Maybe if there's interest head to a bar for more discussion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of course, every OpenHack is going to be different. These are simply guidelines, and they're meant to be <a href="https://github.com/openhack/openhack.github.com">forked</a>. We'd love to hear feedback and see how OpenHack works in other cities!</a>

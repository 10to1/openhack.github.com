## Chicago

### Info

Open Hack Night meets in Chicago roughly once a month to code together,
eat together, and hang out with like minded techies.  The event is open
to programmers of all skill levels and from any programming community.

### Next meetups

* Check back soon - we're looking for a venue for our first meeting, if
  you know of some place that can host 20-30 folks for an evening let us
know.

### Past meetups

Haven't done one yet but we're working on it.
